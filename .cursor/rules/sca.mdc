# Dependency Vulnerability Safety Rule

Whenever you add or modify a dependency in any of the files above, or if I ask about insecure dependencies and potential upgrades:

- Run `endor-cli-tools` using the `check_dependency_for_vulnerabilities` tool.
- Provide the **language**, **dependency name**, and **version**.
- If the tool identifies a vulnerability:
  - Upgrade to the suggested safe version, or
  - Replace the dependency with a non-vulnerable alternative.

This rule ensures that all dependency changes are evaluated for risk at the time of introduction, and that the project remains clean and secure after each coding session.
