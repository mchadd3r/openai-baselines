# Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Rule

Whenever a supported source code file is modified, or if asked to check for insecure code:
1. Use the MCP server and `endor-cli-tools` with `scan` tools and `--sast` argument to perform a SAST scan on the modified source files.

3. If any vulnerabilities are found:
   - Present the issues to the user.
   - Recommend appropriate fixes (e.g., input sanitization, validation, escaping, secure APIs).
   - Continue scanning until all critical issues have been resolved.

This rule ensures all code changes are automatically reviewed for common security vulnerabilities using `endor-cli-tools` and the MCP server, with Semgrep as the underlying engine.
