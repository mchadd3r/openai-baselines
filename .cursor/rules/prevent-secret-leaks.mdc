# Leaked Secrets Detection Rule

Whenever a file is modified in the repository, or if I ask for a secrets scan:
1. Run `endor-cli-tools` using the `scan` tool with `--secrets` argument.
- Ensure the scan includes all file types and respects `.gitignore` unless otherwise configured.
- If any secrets are detected:
  - Remove the exposed secret immediately.
  - Re-scan to verify the secret has been properly removed.

This rule ensures no accidental credentials, tokens, API keys, or secrets are committed or remain in the project history.
